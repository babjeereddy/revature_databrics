What is Structured Streaming?
Structured Streaming is Apache Spark’s scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on Spark SQL.

	Treats streaming data as an unbounded table that is continuously appended with new rows.
	Enables you to write streaming jobs using the same DataFrame/Dataset API used for batch processing.

Key Concepts
	Unbounded Table
		Incoming data = continuous new rows.
		Queries run incrementally as new data arrives.

Trigger
	Controls when the next micro-batch should run
	(e.g., trigger(processingTime="10 seconds")).

Checkpointing
	Used to store metadata, offsets, and progress to ensure fault tolerance and 	exactly-once guarantees.

Input Sources
	File Sources (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
	Socket Source (testing)
	Kafka (real-time)
	Rate Source (built-in test generator)
	Delta Tables

4. Output Modes
Append
	Writes only newly added rows
	(works when aggregations do not update previous values).
Update
	Writes only rows whose values changed compared to the previous micro-batch.

Complete
	Rewrites the entire result table (useful for aggregations like counts).

Sinks (Output Targets)
	Console
	File sinks (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
	Kafka
	Memory sink (for debugging)
	Delta Lake sink
