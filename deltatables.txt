A Delta Table is a modern storage format built on top of Apache Parquet that brings ACID transactions, Time Travel, Schema Enforcement, and fast upserts/merges to data lakes.
It is part of Delta Lake, widely used with Apache Spark.
Delta Table = Parquet + Transaction Log + ACID + Features

A Delta table adds a transaction log folder (_delta_log) inside the data directory to track:

	Inserts
	Updates
	Deletes
	Merges
	Schema changes
	Versions
	Timestamps

This makes your data lake behave like a database.

Key Features of Delta Tables
	1. ACID Transactions
	
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
→ Multiple users/workflows can safely read/write at the same time.

Time Travel
	You can query older versions of data.

Schema Enforcement
	Prevents bad or incompatible data from entering your table.
	 Upsert / Merge

Fast Reads & Writes
	It uses Parquet + indexing + caching.

Streaming Support
	Can be used for batch + streaming on the same table.
